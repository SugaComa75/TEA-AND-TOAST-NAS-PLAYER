## How to Activate SQLite in XAMPP/LAMPP

If you are using **XAMPP** or **LAMPP** and encounter issues with SQLite, follow these instructions to enable it:

### For XAMPP (Windows/macOS)
1. Open your `php.ini` file (usually found in `xampp/php/php.ini`).
2. Ensure these lines are **not** commented (remove the leading semicolon `;` if present):
    ```ini
    extension=pdo_sqlite
    extension=sqlite3
    ```
3. Save and restart Apache using the XAMPP control panel.

### For LAMPP (Linux)
1. Open `/opt/lampp/etc/php.ini`.
2. Ensure:
    ```ini
    extension=pdo_sqlite
    extension=sqlite3
    ```
3. Save and restart Apache:
    ```bash
    sudo /opt/lampp/lampp restart
    ```

### Verify SQLite is enabled
* Create a `phpinfo.php` file:
    ```php
    <?php phpinfo(); ?>
    ```
* Open it in your browser and verify that `sqlite3` and `pdo_sqlite` are listed under active PDO drivers.

---

## Installation

1. Place the application in any web-accessible directory, such as /public_html/music. The bundled getID3 library is already included.

2. Ensure PHP 7.4+ has PDO SQLite, mbstring, fileinfo, and GD enabled.

3. Open install.php in the browser. Enter an absolute NAS media root, a separate private data root, and the first Super Administrator account.

4. When setup succeeds, **delete install.php from the server**.

5. Open the app, visit ?access=admin, and run Full Scan. Later registrations create ordinary unverified accounts; verify them in the admin panel before allowing uploads.

See [Installation and NAS configuration](docs/INSTALLATION.md) and [Registration and administrator accounts](docs/AUTHENTICATION.md) for the complete workflow.

## How does it work?

* **index.php** is both the backend API (`?action=...`) and the single-page frontend application.
* User authentication is session-based (server-side PHP sessions) with persistent year-long session and cookie lifetimes.
* User uploads are separated—each user can only manage and edit their own uploads.
* Playback runs via an advanced dual HTML5 `<audio>` engine and Web Audio API routing `(Source -> Gain Node -> 5-Band EQ Filters -> Dynamics Compressor -> Destination)` for gapless crossfading and real-time audio enhancements, utilizing the Media Session API.
* Scanning uses getID3 for database indexing, storing everything in `music.db` (SQLite).
* Album art and profile pictures are extracted, resized, and converted to `.webp` on the fly to save space and bandwidth. Custom edited cover images are mirrored in `covers/songs` and `covers/albums` folders.
* PWA support includes a web manifest and a customized service worker (`?pwa=manifest`, `?pwa=sw`) to handle offline caching. 
* **Offline Audio Handling**: The Service Worker intercepts audio stream requests (`?action=get_stream`) and seamlessly constructs `206 Partial Content` range slices from cached file buffers, enabling background media seeking even when fully offline.
* Uploads are safely stored in `/uploads/{artist_slug}/` directories.
* Complete metadata modification is supported via the `edit_metadata` action which updates the database, writes ID3 tags back into the file using getID3's writetags function, and mirrors covers in dedicated folders.
* The built-in PHPEditor uses Ace Editor for syntax highlighting and interacts seamlessly with the server's file system, tracking file versions for easy rollback.
* Playlists, offline lists, and favorites support fluid drag-and-drop ordering powered by SortableJS, pushing positional arrays back to the server.
* Collaborative playlists track individual song contributions via an `added_by` column on the `playlist_songs` table, and authenticate editor permissions securely using a `playlist_collaborators` lookup.
* Play histories and view counts are continuously logged locally (after 30 seconds of playback) to generate personalized "For You" shelves and track statistics.
* Secure transactional storage models like `personal_notes`, `tasks`, `blogs`, `blog_comments`, `song_comments`, `community_posts`, `listen_later`, and `messages` are safely indexed with Foreign Key constraints referencing the user session state.
* The `follows` and `blocks` tables tightly control user-to-user social networking and privacy boundaries.
* Rhythm Game beatmaps are generated deterministically using a Xorshift RNG seeded by song ID and difficulty, producing consistent charts across playthroughs.
* The Image Editor uses Fabric.js for canvas manipulation, supporting layers, filters, and export.
* Real-time collaboration sync for notes, tasks, blogs, and image editor projects uses Server-Sent Events (SSE) over the same PHP backend, eliminating the need for a separate WebSocket server.
* PHPShares artwork and manga are stored with files and thumbnails; the reader uses lazy loading for performance.

## Customization

* **Colors**: Edit CSS variables (`--ytm-bg`, `--ytm-accent`, etc.) in the `<style>` block inside `index.php`.
* **Audio formats**: Adjust the regex (`/\.(mp3|m4a|flac|ogg|wav)$/i`) in `perform_full_scan()` within `index.php` to add or restrict formats.
* **Remote sources**: Would require backend refactoring.
* **Public/Internet use**: Built with public sharing in mind, but it is advised to use SSL/TLS.

## Security

* **Warning:** Intended for personal use on your own server or LAN, though robust enough for small community instances.
* Each user is securely sandboxed to their own uploads, favorites, playlists, notes, tasks, blogs, and profile.
* Users must be explicitly verified by an admin before they are allowed to upload music.
* File types, image processing (only accepts standard images and converts to WebP/JPEG), and tag decoding use sanitized structures to mitigate basic injection attacks.
* The Admin panel is strictly protected by a securely hashed password. Banned accounts are checked upon every login attempt.

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Potential Cause | Solution |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Scan errors or empty library** | Missing getID3, wrong directory permissions, or missing `pdo_sqlite` driver. | Ensure `getid3/` folder is present, check directory write permissions, and uncomment sqlite extensions in `php.ini`. |
| **Upload errors / File too large** | Large FLAC/WAV files blocking PHP limits, or unverified account. | Verify account has been verified by the admin. Update `upload_max_filesize` and `post_max_size` in `php.ini`. |
| **Metadata or lyrics not saving** | Strict file permission constraints. | Grant write permissions to the audio files so PHP can use getID3's writetags function. |
| **Lyrics not syncing** | Timestamp formatting issues in LRC file. | Ensure timestamps are followed by a space (e.g., `[00:15.30] Lyric text` instead of `[00:15.30]Lyric text`). |
| **Invisible user playlists or songs** | SQL syntax crashes due to missing DB columns or failed tables. | Ensure the database structure is upgraded. (Fixed in latest code via independent column checks). |
| **Rhythm Game notes not appearing** | Chart generation may not have completed for that song. | Run "Scan Charts" from the sidebar (admin only) or wait for automatic generation on first play. |
| **Chat messages not sending** | Browser may be blocking notifications or WebSocket fallback (SSE) disabled. | Check browser console for errors; SSE requires `session_write_close()` during polling, which is handled automatically. |
| **Image Editor layers not loading** | Browser may have insufficient memory for large images. | Try reducing image resolution or using the "Reset Canvas" option. |
| **PHPShares upload fails** | PHP memory limits or incorrect file permissions. | Increase `memory_limit` and `post_max_size` in `php.ini`; ensure `phpshares/` directory is writable. |
